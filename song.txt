I've been away a little while
Sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind's running wild
I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard
The crazy things the voices tell me to do
But it's no use
I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me, I've tried; in the end, I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me me
