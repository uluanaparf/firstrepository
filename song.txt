I've been away a little while
Sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind's running wild
I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard
The crazy things the voices tell me to do
But it's no use
I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me, I've tried; in the end, I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me me
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room
I saw the world a couple times
Tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole
